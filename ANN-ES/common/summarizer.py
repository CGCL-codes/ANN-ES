Although the rebels presumed that all data about Calderos Station was erased , Bail ' s adopted daughter , Prince ss Leia Organa , managed to find some old space traffic data which linked Crait and Calderos Station . To discover the identity of the attacker , Leia Organa and her guard Lieutenant Ress Batten traveled to Crait aboard the \" Polestar \" . After the ship landed on the planet surface , Leia was detained by rebel soldier s as she refused their proposal to leave Crait immediately .
